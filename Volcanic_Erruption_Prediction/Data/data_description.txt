Detecting volcanic eruptions before they happen is an important problem that has historically proven to be a very difficult. This competition provides you with readings from several seismic sensors around a volcano and challenges you to estimate how long it will be until the next eruption. The data represent a classic signal processing setup that has resisted traditional methods.

Identifying the exact sensors may be possible but would not be in the spirit of the competition nor further the scientific objectives. Please respect the importance of the problem and the time invested by the researchers at INGV in making this problem available by not seeking more metadata or information that would be unavailable in a real prediction context.
